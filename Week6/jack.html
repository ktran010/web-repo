    <!-- Jack, note here that I moved your <img> to sit above <h2>, rather than sit
    after <p>. So, instead of being at line 36, I moved your <img> to line 30.

    The reason I did this is so that when I float the image to the right,
    the image is sitting in the top right corner of the section. It's easier
    to mess around with the image's placement in that way, instead of putting the image
    right after the paragraph and dealing with the image starting off further down your <section>
    rather than already sitting at the top right corner of the section. -->

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>Copper mountain is located in Summit County, Colorado, 75 miles west of Denver. Copper
      stands only a few miles away from other well-known resorts, <a href="https://www.breckenridge.com/">Breckenridge</a> and <a href="https://www.vail.com/">Vail Mountain</a>.
      Thus, making Summit County one of the ski capitals of the country. The drive from Denver is only
      about an hour and a half long, and the scenery along I-70 is an experience in itself.</p>
